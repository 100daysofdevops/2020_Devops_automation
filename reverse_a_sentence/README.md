**Problem**: Given a string of words, reverse all the words. For example

Given
   ```"Welcome to Python"```

Return
    ```"Python to Welcome"```

**NOTE**: As part of this exercise, please remove all leading and trailing whitespaces. 
For example
   
   ``` "  Python example " ```

     become
     
     ``` "Python example"```

**Solution**: Again we can follow multiple approach to solve this problem
1: Take Python built-in functions like split() and reversed()
2: More feasible solution during interview situation is to loop over the text and extract the words
